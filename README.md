# JEE_NEET_predictor-database-project
This is a database project in php and sql . <br>
Here we first ask users to make an account .<br>
We then store these details and provide the user a unique registration number .<br>
The user then has to log in with this registration number and their passsword .<br> 
The user now has to enter their marks in individual subjects .<br>
After that we compare the marks with all the other entries in the database and then calculate their percentile and based on that we tell whether they qualified or not .<br>
For JEE the cut off percentile has been already set at 90 and for NEET it has been set to 50 .<br>
The user can enter marks multiple times but their marks would be <b>updated</b> only <b>if</b> their <b>total marks are highest of all their previous totals.</b>
Motivation behind this was that in JEE mains the best score out of all the attempts is cosidered for the final result .<br>
In this project all the garbage values and garbage inputs have been considered and properly handled .

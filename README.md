# JEE_NEET_predictor-database-project
This is a database project in php and sql . <br>
Here we first ask users to make an account .We then store the details and ask the user to enter their marks in individual subjects . 
After that we compare the marks with all the other entries in the database and after that we calculate their percentile and based on  that we tell whether they qualified or not .
For JEE the cut off percentile has been already set at 90 and for NEET it has been set to 50 .
In this project all the garbage values and garbage inputs have been considered and properly handled .
